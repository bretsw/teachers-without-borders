# Teachers Without Borders: Professional Learning Spanning Social Media, Place, and Time

## Abstract 

As new technologies shape and are shaped by human practices, educators must consider how today’s technology-mediated environments expand our conceptualization of learning contexts and the continuities and tensions between learning and participation in various settings. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted educational systems worldwide, necessitating emergency remote teaching and coinciding with increased social media use. Such shifts require our reconceptualization of the boundaries of learning in a digital age. This article explores British and American teachers’ experiences of professional learning spanning social media, place and time. We collected #UKEdchat tweets and #Edchat tweets over a 28-month time period, January 1, 2019–April 30, 2021 and from tweets, identified tweeters who were middle or secondary school teachers in the U.K. and U.S. to interview. From analysis of these data, we report on the tensions, synergies and experiences of boundary-crossing teachers with implications for research and practice.
