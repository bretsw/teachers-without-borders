# Teachers Without Borders: Professional Learning Spanning Social Media, Place, and Time

## Abstract 

As new technologies shape and are shaped by human practices, educators and researchers must consider how today’s technology-mediated environments expand our conceptualization of learning contexts and the continuities and tensions between learning and participation in various settings. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted educational systems worldwide. Teachers and students rapidly transitioned to emergency remote teaching. This shift coincided with existing trends towards self-directed learning and social media use. Such shifts in the educational landscape require our reconceptualization of the boundaries of learning in a digital age. Toward this reconceptualization, this article explores British and American teachers’ experiences of formal and informal professional learning. We collected 353,196 #UKEdchat tweets and 2,491,244 #Edchat tweets spanning a 28-month time period, January 1, 2019–April 30, 2021. From tweets containing questions tweets, we identified high frequency question tweeters; we manually reviewed these tweeters’ profiles and tweets to identify a smaller sample of secondary school teachers in the U.K. and U.S. to interview. We interviewed XX teachers and analyzed qualitative data from these interviews. Methods, findings, implications for “boundaries of learning in the context of new technology.”
